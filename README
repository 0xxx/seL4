'make' instructions
===================

tl;dr: TOOLPREFIX=arm-none-eabi- ARCH=arm PLAT=imx31 ARMV=armv6 \
       CPU=arm1136jf-s make

The kernel source requires a cross-compiler for the target architecture. To
build using make, follow these instructions:

 * Ensure that the appropriate cross-compiler is installed.

 * Set the TOOLPREFIX environment variable.  eg. arm-none-eabi- if the ERTOS
   compilers are in your PATH.

 * Set the ARCH, PLAT, ARMV and CPU variables for the intended target
   architecture and platform, chosen from the following lists:

    ARCH   PLAT    ARMV      CPU
    ------------------------------------
    arm    imx31   armv6     arm1136jf-s
    arm    omap3   armv7-a   cortex-a8
    arm    am335x  armv7-a   cortex-a8
    ia32   pc99

 * For a debug build, append -DDEBUG.
