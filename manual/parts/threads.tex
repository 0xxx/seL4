\chapter{\label{ch:threads}Threads and Execution}

\section{Threads}
\label{sec:threads}

seL4 provides threads to represent an execution context and manage
processor time. A thread is represented in seL4 by its thread control block
object (\obj{TCB}). Each \obj{TCB} has an associated CSpace (see
\autoref{ch:cspace}) and VSpace (see \autoref{ch:vspace}) which
may be shared with other threads. A \obj{TCB} may also have an IPC buffer
(see  \autoref{ch:ipc}), which is used to pass extra arguments during IPC
or kernel object invocation that do not fit in the architecture-defined message
registers. While it is not compulsory that a thread has an IPC buffer,
it will not be able to perform most kernel invocations, as they require
cap transfer.
%FIXME: there is much more information held in the TCB!

\subsection{Thread Creation}

Like other objects, \obj{TCB}s are created with the
\apifunc{seL4\_Untyped\_Retype}{untyped_retype} method (see
\autoref{sec:kernmemalloc}). A newly created thread is initially inactive. It
is configured by setting its CSpace and VSpace with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetSpace}{tcb_setspace}
or \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} methods and then calling
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} with an initial stack pointer and instruction
pointer. The thread can then be activated either by setting the
\texttt{resume\_target} parameter in the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} invocation to true
or by seperately calling the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Resume}{tcb_resume} method.

\subsection{Thread Deactivation}
\label{sec:thread_deactivation}

The \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Suspend}{tcb_suspend} method deactivates a thread.
Suspended threads can later be resumed.
Their suspended state can be retrieved with the 
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_ReadRegisters}{tcb_readregisters} and
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_CopyRegisters}{tcb_copyregisters} methods.
They can also be reconfigured and
reused or left suspended indefinitely if not needed. Threads will be
automatically suspended when the last capability to their \obj{TCB} is
deleted.
When threads are suspended, any active IPCs or signals are cancelled.
% an example of which is demonstrated in \nameref{ex:second_thread}.

\subsection{Scheduling Contexts}
\sec{sec:scheduling_contexts}

Thread's access to CPU execution time is controlled through the scheduling context objects that they are 
bound to. 
Scheduling contexts consist of a a tuple of 
\textit{budget (b)} and \textit{period (p)}, both in microseconds, set by \apifunc{seL4\_SchedContext\_Configure}.
The tuple $(b, p)$ forms an upper bound on the thread's execution -- 
the kernel will not permit a thread to run for more than $b$ out of every $p$ microseconds.
However, $\frac{b}{p}$ does not represent a lower bound on execution, as a thread must have the highest or equal highest of all runnable threads to be guaranteed to be scheduled at all.

Whenever a thread is executing it cosumes the budget from its scheduling context.
When the budget expires the thread is preempted and will not be schedulable again until the period has passed, at which 
point the budget will be replenished.
If more than one thread at the same priority has budget available, they will be scheduled first-in first-out.
When a thread's budget expires, the next thread at that priority with budget available will be chosen by the scheduler.
When $b = p$, $b$ simply acts as a timeslice for a thread in a round-robin scheduler, as the budget is always replenished immediately after it expires.

The system call \apifunc{seL4\_SchedContext\_Yield} can be used to sacrifice any remaining budget and block until the budget is replenished.

Threads can be bound to scheduling contexts using \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} or 
\apifunc{seL4\_SchedContext\_BindTCB}{schedcontext_bindtcb}, both invocations have the same effect although \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure} allows more thread fields to be set with only one kernel entry. 
When a thread is bound to a scheduling context, if it is in a runnable state and the scheduling context has budget
available, it will be added to the scheduler.

Threads can be unbound from a scheduling context with 
\apifunc{seL4\_SchedContext\_UnbindTCB}{schedcontext_unbindtcb}. 
This is distinct from suspending a thread, in that threads that are blocked an endpoint or notification will remain 
in the queue and can still recieve messages and signals. 
However, the unbound thread will not be schedulable again until it receives a scheduling context.

\subsection{Scheduling}
\label{sec:sched}

seL4 uses a preemptive, tickless, scheduler with 256 priority levels (0 --- 255).
Thread priority (structure \texttt{seL4\_Prio\_t}) consists of two values, priority and max-priority.
When a thread creates or modifies another thread, it can only set the
other thread's priority and max-priority to be lower than or equal to its own max-priority. Thread priority and max-priority can be
set with \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} and
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetPriority}{tcb_setpriority}, \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetMaxPriority}{tcb_setmaxpriority} methods.

\subsection{Exceptions}

Each thread has an associated exception-handler endpoint. If the thread
causes an exception, the kernel creates an IPC message with the relevant
details and sends this to the endpoint. This
thread can then take the appropriate action. Fault IPC messages are
described in \autoref{sec:faults}.

In order to enable exception handlers, a capability to the exception-handler
endpoint must exist in the CSpace of the thread that generates the exception.
The exception-handler
endpoint can be set with the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetSpace}{tcb_setspace} or
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} method.
With these methods, a capability address for the exception handler can be associated with a thread.
This address is then used to lookup the handler endpoint when an exception is generated.
Note, however, that these methods make no attempt to check whether an endpoint capability exists at the specified
address in the CSpace of the thread. The capability is only looked up
when an exception actually happens and if the lookup fails then no
exception message is delivered and the thread is suspended indefinitely.

The exception endpoint must have send and grant rights. Replying to the
exception message restarts the thread. For certain exception types, the contents of
the reply message may be used to set the values in the registers of the
thread being restarted.
See \autoref{sec:faults} for details.



\subsection{Message Layout of the Read-/Write-Registers Methods}
\label{sec:read_write_registers}

The registers of a thread can be read and written with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_ReadRegisters}{tcb_readregisters} and \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} methods. The register contents are transferred via the IPC buffer. The IPC buffer locations that registers are copied to/from are given below.

\section{Faults}
\label{sec:faults}

A thread's actions may result in a fault. Faults are delivered to the
thread's exception handler so that it can take the appropriate action.
The fault type is specified in the message label and is one of:
seL4\_CapFault, seL4\_VMFault, seL4\_UnknownSyscall, seL4\_UserException
or seL4\_Interrupt.

\subsection{Capability Faults}

Capability faults may occur in two places. Firstly, a capability fault
can occur when lookup of a capability referenced by a
\apifunc{seL4\_Call}{sel4_call} or \apifunc{seL4\_Send}{sel4_send} system call
failed (\apifunc{seL4\_NBSend}{sel4_nbsend} calls on
invalid capabilities silently fail). In this case, the capability
on which the fault occurred may be the capability being invoked or an
extra capability passed in the \texttt{caps} field in the IPC buffer.

Secondly, a capability fault can occur when \apifunc{seL4\_Recv}{sel4_recv} or \apifunc{seL4\_NBRecv}{sel4_nbrecv}
is called on a capability that does not exist, is not an endpoint or notification capability or does not have
receive permissions.

Replying to the fault IPC will restart the faulting thread. The contents of the
IPC message are given in \autoref{tbl:ipc_contents}.\\

\noindent\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XX}

\textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{IPC buffer Location} \\
\midrule
Address at which to restart execution & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[0]} \\
Capability address & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[1]}\\
In receive phase (1 if the fault happened during a receive system call, 0
otherwise) & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[2]}\\
Lookup failure description. As described in \autoref{sec:lookup_fail_desc} &
\ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[3..]}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{\label{tbl:ipc_contents}Contents of an IPC message.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Unknown Syscall}
\label{sec:unknown-syscall}

This fault occurs when a thread executes a system call with a syscall
number that is unknown to seL4.
The register set
of the faulting thread is passed to the thread's exception handler so that it
may, for example, emulate the system call if a thread is being
virtualised.

Replying to the fault IPC allows the thread to be restarted
and/or the thread's register set to be modified. If the reply has
a label of zero, the thread will be restarted. Additionally, if the
message length is non-zero, the faulting thread's register set will be
updated as shown in \autoref{tbl:unknown_syscall_result_arm} \ifxeightsix and
\autoref{tbl:unknown_syscall_result_ia32}\fi. In this case, the number of
registers updated is controlled with the length field of the message
tag.

\subsection{User Exception}

User exceptions are used to deliver architecture-defined exceptions. For
example, such an exception could occur if a user thread attempted to
divide a number by zero.

Replying to the fault IPC allows the thread to be restarted
and/or the thread's register set to be modified. If the reply has
a label of zero, the thread will be restarted. Additionally, if the
message length is non-zero, the faulting thread's register set will be
updated as shown in \autoref{tbl:user_exception_result_arm} \ifxeightsix and
\autoref{tbl:user_exception_result_ia32}\fi. In this case, the number of
registers updated is controlled with the length field of the message
tag.
