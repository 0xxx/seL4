\chapter{\label{ch:notifications}Notifications}

\BEGCHECK
Notifications are a simple, non-blocking signalling mechanism that
logically represents a set of binary semaphores.

\section{Notification Objects}

A \obj{Notification} object contains a single data word, called the
\emph{notification word}. Such an object supports two operations:
\apifunc{seL4\_Signal}{sel4_signal} and
\apifunc{seL4\_Wait}{sel4_wait}.

\obj{Notification} capabilities can be badged, using
\apifunc{seL4\_CNode\_Mutate}{cnode_mutate} or
\apifunc{seL4\_CNode\_Mint}{cnode_mint}, just like \obj{Endpoint}
capabilities (see \autoref{sec:ep-badges}). As with \obj{Endpoint}
capabilities, badged \obj{Notification} capabilities cannot be
  unbadged, rebadged or used to create child capabilities with
  different badges. \label{s:notif-badge}

\section{Signalling and Waiting}

The \apifunc{seL4\_Signal}{sel4_signal} method updates the
notification word by bit-wise \texttt{or}-ing it with the \emph{badge}
of the invoked notification capability. It also unblocks the first
thread waiting on the notification (if any). As such,
\apifunc{seL4\_Signal}{sel4_signal} works like concurrently signalling
multiple semaphores (those indicated by the bits set in the badge).

The \apifunc{seL4\_Wait}{sel4_wait} method works similar to a
select-like wait on the set of semaphores: If the notification word is
zero at the time \apifunc{seL4\_Wait}{sel4_wait} is called, the
invoker blocks. Else, the call returns immediately, setting the
notification word to zero and returning to the invoker the previous
notification-word value.

If threads are waiting on the \obj{Notification} object at the time
\apifunc{seL4\_Signal}{sel4_signal} is invoked, first queued thread
receives the notification, while all others keep waiting until the
next time the notification is signalled. 

If \apifunc{seL4\_Signal}{sel4_signal} is invoked with an unbadged
capability, the first queued thread is unblocked (with a zero return
value). If no thread is waiting, the
\apifunc{seL4\_Signal}{sel4_signal} operation is a no-op.
