    help
        Cortex-A9 has an L1 and L2 prefetcher. By default
        they are disabled. This config options allows
        them to be turned on. Enabling the prefetchers
        requires that the kernel be in secure mode. ARM
        documents indicate that as of r4p1 version of
        Cortex-A9 the bits used to enable the prefetchers
        no longer exist, it is not clear if this is just
        a document error or not.
